**card_scanner** is a flutter plugin for accurately and quickly scanning debit and credit cards.
**card_scanner** was orginally forked from [Natesh Bhat](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/card-scanner-flutter).

## Features

- 🔒Fully **OFFLINE** scan makes it a completely **secure scanner** !
- 🎈 Can scan **Expiry date** , **Card Holder name** and **Card Issuer** (lacked by other scanners) along with the **Card number**✨
- 🔋Powered by Google's Machine Learning models
- ⚡ Great performance and accuracy
- 🧹Auto checks the card number for errors using card checksum algorithms
- 🎚Supports controlling parameters that determine the balance between speed and accuracy
- ❤️ Simple, powerful, & intuitive API

## Install

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  card_scanner: <latest-version>
```

> get the [latest version number here](https://pub.dev/packages/card_scanner#-installing-tab-)

## Usage

Just import the package and call `scanCard`:

```dart
import 'package:card_scanner/card_scanner.dart';
var cardDetails = await CardScanner.scanCard();

print(cardDetails);
```

Example Output:

```dart
Card Number = 5173949117389006
Expiry Date = 11/26
```

The above code opens the device camera, looks for a valid card and gets the required details and returns the `CardDetails` object.

---

### Scan Options

If you wish to obtain the card holder name and card issuer, you can specify the options:

```dart
import 'package:card_scanner/card_scanner.dart';
var cardDetails = await CardScanner.scanCard(
    scanOptions: CardScanOptions(
        scanCardHolderName: true,
        scanCardIssuer: true,
    ),
);


print(cardDetails);
```

Example Output :

```dart
Card Number = 5173949117389006
Expiry Date = 11/26
Card Issuer = mastercard
Card Holder Name = PAUL SAMUELSON
```

## iOS Requirements
